# greet-me

<!-- Plugin description -->
**This plugin can greet you if you feel alone during codingüòä.**

I also played with CI/CD process during this plugin development, so it may seem a bit overcomplicated,
but it helped me a lot with understanding Github Actions :)

Oh, and also there is a custom  dialog wrapper I wrote, but I don't use it now as there is an easier
way to create simple dialog windows.
